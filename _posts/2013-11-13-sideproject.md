# Reflecting on the Sale of a Side Project: The Journey of WeddingDeck
*Date: November 13, 2013*

> Note: Once upon a time, I had a lot of free time, and I built a lot of side projects. This is the story of one of them.

Today marks a bittersweet moment in my journey as a developer. I've just sold my side project, WeddingDeck, after dedicating over 100 hours to it. The sale price? Only a few hundred dollars. This experience, though somewhat disheartening, is a tale familiar to many in the realm of side projects – a burst of coding energy that gradually wanes until the project is left frozen in time.

**The Decision to Sell**

I reached a point where I contemplated shutting down WeddingDeck entirely. Lack of focus, dwindling interest, and working solo all contributed to its gradual decline. There was even a time when just looking at the code gave me a headache, and my mind yearned to wander elsewhere.

Then, out of the blue, someone expressed interest in buying the project. After a brief negotiation, WeddingDeck was sold, and within a day, everything was transferred. As I helped the buyer get started and reviewed the code, I was struck by the sheer volume of work I had put into it. The realization hit me hard – I had sold my biggest project for almost nothing.

**Lessons Learned: The Hard Truths**

From this venture, I gained insights that, while they may seem obvious, are often overlooked:

1. **The Challenge of Solo Projects:**
   While it's possible to start a project alone (as many successful serial entrepreneurs do), I've learned that working solo has its drawbacks. Lack of advice, minimal challenges, and no shared excitement can take a toll. Starting a side project alone often stems from boredom with day-to-day job coding, but transforming it into a successful business is a different ballgame. This idea echoes the sentiments expressed by many, including in some of Paul Graham's writings, where it's listed as a top startup mistake.

2. **Passion is Key:**
   Ironically, I'm not passionate about weddings. I'm not married, nor do I plan to be. However, I recognized a gap in the market for quality wedding apps and set out to create the best one possible, resulting in a solid MVP and 8,000 free users without much effort. Despite this success, I couldn't see myself fully immersed in the world of weddings, attending conventions and promoting my app. This lack of personal connection ultimately influenced my decision to sell.

**Moving Forward: What's Next?**

So, WeddingDeck is now in the past. The project, though not as fruitful as hoped, was a learning experience. It underscored the importance of collaboration and following your passions. As I move on to new ventures, these lessons will shape my approach, hopefully leading to more fulfilling and successful projects.
