# Where front-end web development will be in 5 years?
*Date: March 30, 2009*

> Note: Reflecting on this post, it's fascinating to realize that when I wrote this, I was still figuring out the direction of my career. Now, with a clearer understanding, I've come to appreciate that sometimes, the role of a senior engineer can be the most fulfilling and appealing position one can hold.


As the year draws to a close, it's natural to ponder about the future. Like many, I've set personal goals for the new year (yes, including losing 5 pounds!), but professionally, I'm particularly intrigued by where front-end development might be heading in the next five years.

**Mobile Web Development: The Rising Star**

The trajectory for mobile web development seems incredibly promising. With the rapid evolution of mobile platforms like the iPhone and Android, and the increasing affordability of internet access on smartphones, there's no doubt that mobile web development will see significant growth. As front-end developers, we need to be ready to create CSS templates specifically tailored for mobile devices, marking a shift in how we approach web design.

**The Decline of Internet Explorer**

While this might be more wishful thinking than a solid prediction, I foresee Internet Explorer losing its dominance. With the rise of Google Chrome and Macintosh computers, the share of Internet Explorer 8 and 9 could drop to around 40%. Hopefully, IE6 will become nothing but a distant, unpleasant memory, and IE7 will fade away as users upgrade their Windows systems.

Interestingly, while most of my client websites currently have an IE share of about 65%, this blog enjoys a mere 10% IE share out of 33,000 visitors over six months – a trend I'm quite happy about!

**JavaScript Libraries: A Mainstay in Development**

The use of JavaScript libraries is becoming increasingly common. jQuery, in particular, has gained a lot of attention, and it's my library of choice. The next five years might bring changes in this area, but the thought of mastering multiple libraries isn't particularly appealing.

**The Dawn of HTML5 and CSS3**

With the advent of IE9, we'll likely start seeing HTML5 and CSS3 being used more extensively for mainstream website development. Although this shift might take time – five years might even be optimistic – it's an exciting prospect for front-end developers.

**Job Security for Front-End Developers**

There's always a concern about job security, especially with the rapid pace of technological change. However, I believe that front-end development is here to stay. The demand for new templates and website redesigns seems endless, indicating a steady need for skilled front-end developers.

**My Personal Aspirations**

Looking ahead, I see myself evolving into roles like an Information Web Architect or a UI Web Designer. As for the upcoming year and this blog, I have three JavaScript projects in the pipeline – a new inline form validation using CSS3, a pixel-perfect development tool, and a product viewer effect similar to what Zazzle has. The product viewer is already in advanced stages of development, although some mathematical challenges might slow down its completion.

**Your Thoughts?**

As we stand at the cusp of these exciting developments, I'm curious about your views. What do you think the landscape of front-end development will look like in five years?

Let's start a conversation and envision the future of our field together.
