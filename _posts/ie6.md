# Navigating the Quirks of IE6: A Developer's Dilemma
*Date: April 28, 2009*

> Note: This is a blast from the past, where my biggest concern was that my floated divs would break my content column on ie6.

As a front-end developer, I've often found myself at a crossroads: should I use an IE6-specific stylesheet for each bug I encounter, or is it better to delve into my website's code to identify and fix the underlying issue? This dilemma is not just about finding a quick solution, but about understanding the most efficient and effective approach to web development.

**The Allure of Quick Fixes vs. The Rigor of Problem-Solving**

Most of the bugs I've encountered in IE6 could be resolved without resorting to CSS hacks. Interestingly, I've noticed that many of these so-called 'IE6 bugs' were actually small errors in my code, which newer browsers had automatically corrected. This realization led me to a crucial decision in my development process.

I rarely opt for an IE6-specific stylesheet. Instead, I've familiarized myself with the common issues IE6 presents and now implement workarounds from the outset. This proactive approach has significantly strengthened the robustness of my templates. When a template functions seamlessly across IE6, IE7, and Firefox without the need for additional IE-specific styles, I gain confidence in its compatibility across various platforms.

**The Subtle Art of Handling Glitches**

It's undeniable that the IE PNG fix is a necessary evil, but my focus here is on those minor glitches in our templates. Often, these glitches stem from a miscalculation or a minor error in the code. Addressing these issues at their root not only resolves the immediate problem but also enhances the overall quality of the code.

**Reflecting on the Legacy of IE6**

Dealing with IE6 is undoubtedly challenging and, at times, frustrating. With the rapid evolution of web browsers, IE6 is inching towards becoming a relic of the past. While it might seem less relevant to invest time in mastering its quirks, my journey with IE6 has been enlightening. It has exposed flaws in my CSS coding style that I might not have noticed otherwise.

In conclusion, the journey with IE6, albeit challenging, has been a valuable part of my growth as a developer. It has taught me the importance of understanding the intricacies of web development and the need to balance quick fixes with thorough problem-solving. As IE6 fades into the annals of web history, the lessons learned will remain, guiding me in the ever-evolving landscape of front-end development.
