# The front-end developer's burden

Front-end developers often find themselves wearing multiple hats in their roles, positioned as a 'jack of all trades.' Our responsibilities can extend beyond the core tasks, stepping in to fill gaps left by designers or back-end developers. This versatility is a hallmark of our position, as we bridge various aspects of web development.

My personal journey in front-end development is fueled by a passion for both design and programming. While I may not consider myself a master in web design, I am an avid learner, frequently visiting sites like mostinspired.com to stay abreast of the latest trends and techniques. For programming insights, resources like Ajaxrain and Ajaxian have been invaluable, offering updates on cool scripts and programming knowledge.

Despite our expertise, there's often a lack of understanding about what front-end developers do, even within our own companies. It's crucial to note that not all front-end developers have the same skill set. For instance, while some might excel in design, others might not be suited for professional design tasks. Similarly, while we may assist in various areas, expecting us to perform at the level of a seasoned C# or PHP developer might be unrealistic.

A common task that falls to us is integrating content into CMS, which can be quite extensive, especially in a small company setting. This part of the job, often involving managing 50 or more pages, is seldom met with enthusiasm.

The essence of our role lies in our expertise in XHTML/CSS, PSD slicing, website architecture, HTML semantics, JavaScript, and CMS. We are adept at understanding the possibilities and limitations of design and features right from the start. Our skills extend to debugging across various browsers, including the challenging Internet Explorer 6.

However, it's important to recognize the limits of our role. We are sometimes called upon to be designers, developers, and even secretaries. But expectations need to be realistic. Coding a back-end application in an afternoon or transforming into a translator/writer because the content team fell short are tasks beyond our usual scope.

In essence, while we are versatile and adaptable, understanding and respecting the boundaries of our expertise and role is key to a harmonious and productive work environment.
